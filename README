I want to tell you that I have worked with pyinstaller to generate an executable (strategies.exe - Shorcut) assuming that users are not used to working with the console,
as well as to avoid having to install the programs that are necessary to run the script. This led me to have to unify the code in a single file that contains two
functions run_req_res and execution_time. Originally the script was split into a file containing the first function and a second with execution_time, which imports the
run_req_res function to run from this file. If you do not want to clone or download all the content of the repository, you should only use the strategies.py file, which
is where the developed script is located.

The dataset was obtained from the yfinance library, which limits you to one week to request intraday data, so the requirement of two weeks of quotes was not met.
Depending on the requirements of the users, it may be a better option to work with an API or another source that allows analyzing the strategy with intraday data.
